For this controller is added some API information:
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/Payment-Document-API/createPaymentDocument

Not every endpoint is working as expected. But you could create company, create account, create a payment document, 
apply the payment document and receive the operations by account.

You could use the next curls to check the functionality: 

1. Check the existed companies:

curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8080/api/companies/' \
  -H 'accept: */*'

2. Add the new company:

curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/api/companies/' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "companyName": "SomeCompany",
  "companyCode": 98765432,
  "email": "contact@post.com",
  "phone": "+4820948543340"
}'

3. Check if it appears by rerun the first request

4. Create the account for the new company 

curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/api/accounts/' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "accountNumber": "UA547568579867965",
  "accountName": "Main Account",
  "currency": "UAH",
  "amount": 1000000,
  "companyCode": 98765432
}'

}'
